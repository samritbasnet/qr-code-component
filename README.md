## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned flexbox css styling components and added html naming convention for class for different component like qr code and text and paragraph which helped in styling

body {
display: flex;
flex-direction: column;
justify-content: center;
align-items: center;
min-height: 100vh;
margin: 0;
background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
} learned about flexbox and setting margin from this code challenge ```
.qrcode {
border-radius: 10px;
max-width: 100%;
height: auto;
margin-bottom: 20px;
}also added border radius and knew how to do it.

### Continued development

I want to hone my css skills and semantic tags even further so that it would help me in being good frontend developer
